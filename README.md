## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

It's generally a good idea to keep the code editor open on one monitor, and the local browser on the other.

How text looks on a page is called styling. There are 2 methods:
- In-line styling
- CSS files

In-line styling is useful for quick, simple styling, but it quickly becomes unwieldy

CSS file styling is the standard method. We target elements to apply styling to with classes, ids and elements:
- Use a `.` and then a class name to target all elements carrying that class
- Use a `#` and then an id name to target the specific element with that ID
- Use an element name - `div`, `p`, `span`, etc to target all elements of that type
